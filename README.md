## About

This tool automates the process of converting Litematica material lists into the necessary raw materials for Minecraft builds. It streamlines resource gathering by analyzing recipe data directly from Minecraft's `.jar` files. Users can choose output formats (ingots or blocks), track collected materials, and save/load progress in JSON format. The application also provides a search function and quantity formatting for clarity. Please note that the definition of "raw materials" can vary.
