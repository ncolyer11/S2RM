# Schematic to Raw Materials
Takes a materials list generated by the litematica mod, for Minecraft, and calculates how many raw materials are needed. Compiles raw material data from the recipes folder in the version .jar file in .minecraft/versions. Raw materials are slightly subjective btw so beware.

## Beware recipe folder is not complete and only contains the first 1k entries (373 omitted)
Thanks Github
